## Notes

> For me the most important things that makes developer experience easier are Request Object, Response Object and a Router. The rest are nice additions

We can take inspiration from the ExpressJS Framework

Other can be important to consider:

- Middlewares (its a simple way to make the app extensible)
- Template Engine
